# reconstruct_string

# Description
The reconstruct_string function reconstructs a string from a set of paired reads by using a de Bruijn graph approach. It constructs a paired de Bruijn graph from the provided paired reads, finds an Eulerian path within the graph, and reconstructs the original string from that path. This method is commonly used in bioinformatics for genome assembly tasks.


# Features
* Reconstructs the original sequence from paired reads.
* Uses a paired de Bruijn graph to model the sequence structure.
* Finds an Eulerian path to traverse through the graph.
* Reconstructs the string by following the Eulerian path and combining k-mers.

 
# Function
```

def reconstruct_string(k, d, paired_reads):
    """
    Reconstructs the original string from paired reads using a de Bruijn graph and Eulerian path.

    Parameters:
    k (int): The length of the k-mers used for reconstruction.
    d (int): The distance between paired reads.
    paired_reads (list): A list of paired reads, where each element is a string of the form 'kmer1|kmer2'.

    Returns:
    str: The reconstructed string from the Eulerian path.

    graph = create_paired_de_bruijn_graph(paired_reads)
    path = find_eulerian_path(graph)
    return reconstruct_from_path(path, k, d)

# Purpose:
The reconstruct_string function reconstructs the original DNA or RNA sequence from paired-end sequencing data. It relies on the construction of a paired de Bruijn graph and an Eulerian path to reconstruct the string.

# Parameters:
* k (int): The length of the k-mers used to create the graph.
* d (int): The distance between the paired reads in the sequencing data.
* paired_reads (list): A list of paired reads, where each read is a string consisting of two k-mers separated by a pipe (|), representing the paired-end sequencing data.

# Returns:
str: The reconstructed sequence, formed by traversing the Eulerian path in the graph.

# Example
```
k = 4
d = 2
paired_reads = ["GAGA|TTGA", "TCGT|GATG", "CGTG|ATGT", "TGGT|TGAG", "GTGA|TGTT", "GTGG|GTGA", "TGAG|GTTG", "GGTC|GAGA", "GTCG|AGAT"]

result = reconstruct_string(k, d, paired_reads)
print("Reconstructed string:", result)
```

# Expected Output:
GAG|TTGA

# Explanation:
* The function takes in paired reads and uses a de Bruijn graph to model the sequences. The Eulerian path through the graph represents the most likely sequence of the original DNA or RNA, which is reconstructed by the function.

# Applications:
* Genome Assembly: Used in reconstructing the genome sequence from short paired-end reads in high-throughput sequencing.
* Bioinformatics: Key component in assembly algorithms for metagenomic data, transcriptomics, and other sequencing-based applications.
* Next-Generation Sequencing: Critical in handling paired-end sequencing data for accurate assembly and analysis.

# Requirements:
* Python 3.x: This code works with Python 3.x or later versions.
